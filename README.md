# MIPS-Assembly-Projects
Various Assembly MIPS projects developed for the "Computer Organization and Design" class during 2019 2nd semester.

The MIPS projects in this repository were developed as a College activity for the 'Computer Organization and Design' class.

## Setting Up
To run the project you'll need a MIPS simulator. I recommend MARS and you can download it by [clicking here](https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/download.htm) and clicking on 'Download MARS'.


## Files
* CheckingInterval.asm - A basic program that checks which interval an entered number is in. 
* FindingBiggest.asm - A program that returns the biggest of three entered numbers.
* GuessingGame.asm - You have three chances to find what number the computer generated. Try your best and good luck!
* RoboQueSegueLinha.asm - The finals project of the class. Simulation of robotics with MIPS. Basically a robot that finds a line and follow it. 
* Tutorial - Simulacao de robotica com MIPS.pdf - Step by step tutorial, in Portuguese, explaining every decision in the project.


The following images show executions of the robotic simulations with MIPS:
