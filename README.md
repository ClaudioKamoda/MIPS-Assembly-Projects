# MIPS-Assembly-Projects
Various Assembly MIPS projects developed for the "Computer Organization and Design" class during 2019 2nd semester.

The MIPS projects in this repository were developed as a College activity for the 'Computer Organization and Design' class.

## Setting Up
To run the project you'll need a MIPS simulator. I recommend MARS and you can download it by [clicking here](https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/download.htm) and clicking on 'Download MARS'.
